Simulated Web Server Load Balancer. -Developed a robust load balancer for a cloud-based web server cluster using the Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) algorithm in C++ to ensure efficient resource allocation. Engineered WFQ-based load balancing to prioritize traffic, rigorously tested across diverse scenarios including differential bandwidth, processing power, and high-volume stress tests.
